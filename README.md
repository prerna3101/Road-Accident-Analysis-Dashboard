🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

📌 Project Overview

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive Power BI project aimed at visualizing and analyzing road accident data to uncover trends, identify high-risk conditions, and support data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

The dashboard provides comparative insights between the Current Year (CY) and Previous Year (PY) across multiple dimensions such as vehicle type, location, road surface conditions, casualty severity, and more.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze patterns in road accidents and casualty data.

To compare yearly statistics and measure changes in accident trends.

To identify contributing factors such as time of day, road conditions, and vehicle type.

To support traffic safety policy-making and public awareness through clear visual representation.

📊 Dashboard Features

Bikes: 15.6K

Buses: 6.5K

📍 Location-Based Insights:

Urban Areas: 61.95% of casualties

Rural Areas: 38.05%

Most Common Road Types: Single Carriageways (145K), followed by Dual Carriageways (32K)

🌤️ Environmental Conditions:

Lighting: 73.84% of accidents occurred during Daytime, 26.16% during Night
